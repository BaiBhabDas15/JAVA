// Write a java program to define a class Division with two member variables dividend, divisor. Define a method getInput() with Scanner class to take input the values in member variables. Write a method doDivision() to perform division operation. If the divisor is taken as zero, then an exception will be thrown "ArithmeticException", else it will print the result of the operation. Handle exception using try..catch..finally.

// Write a Java program to define a student class with variables studentName, studentProgram, and studentSemester. Define a getData method to take input the record of a student from the user using BufferedReader to take inputs from the user. Handle the exceptions that occur here using IOException. Handle the exception using the throw keyword. Define a show method to print the record of three students.

// Write a Java program to define a class Solitary with two member variables: an array of integers and an integer type size. Initialize the array and size in the constructor. Define a method sort to sort the array in ascending order. If the loop exceeds the size, an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs as the sorting is done. Define a method show to display the sorted array.

// Write a program to implement user defined exception

// 5. Write a java program to define a class BankAccount with member variables cus_name, cus_acc, balance. The methods are:
    a. getData() to initialize the variables
    b. showData() to show record of the customer.
    c. deposit() to deposit the amount and update the balance, if amount <= 0, then throw an exception named "WrongAmount" and print the alert message.
    D. withdraw() to withdraw amount and update balance, if amount > balance, throw an exception named "InsufficientBalance" and print the alert message.
Write the main class to define main() method where create an object of BankAccount class and call the methods.

// 6.Write a java program to define a class StudentGrade with member variables stu_name, stu_grade, grade, marks. The methods are:
     a. getData() to input values for variables using the BufferedReader class (use throws). if the marks enter is not within range (0-100), then throw an exception called WrongMark and print the alert message. If the grade not in O, A+, A, B+, B, C, P, F
     then call exception "InvalidGrade" and print the alert message.
     b. matchGrade() to match marks and grade as given in the following table. If it does not match then throw exception "GradeMismatch" : marks | grade
                     90-100      O
                     80-89       A+
                     70-79       A
                     60-69       B+
                     50-59       B
                     40-49       C
                     30-39       P
                     20-29       F
     c. showData() to display the record of student.
