Java Applet Class Notes


without the web browser, applet does not run,
applet does not need main method for execution, but application programs need main method.
applet is less secure.
applet requires paint() method to run. Applet is tag based.Applet does not support multithreading.

Applet needs help from HTML, hence it is tag based. here we need both a java file and a html file, and this html file invokes the java file.

Applet lifecycle start with the state -> init() (initialisation state), followed by  -> start() (starts execution) -> paint() -> stop() -> destroy()

except paint(), all the other methods are implicitly called, hence paint() method is mandatory.

start() -> paint() -> stop()  => it is a loop, for each browser refresh

1. init() -> this function is called once when the applet starts execution.
2. start() -> this method is repeatedly called each time the applet is started or revisited.
3. paint() -> this method is called when the applet begins execution. It consists one object of Graphics class.
4. stop() -> it is called when the applet is suspended.
5. destroy() -> this method is called when the applet is removed from the memory.
example applet program

import java.applet.Applet;
import java.awt.*;

public class FirstApplet extends Applet{
    public void init() {System.out.println("FirstApplet Init");}
    public void start(){}
    public void paint(Graphics g) {
        g.drawString("FirstApplet", 50, 50);
    }
    public void stop() {}
    public void destroy(){}
}


show.html
<html>
<applet
code = "FirstApplet",
width=200,
height=200>
</applet>
</html>


Assignment 9>
1. write a java applet program to print a message.
2. write a java applet program to take parameter from html and print the value of the parameter to the web browser.
